# Odin-Recipes
This odin recipes website will be my very first website i will design, ever. I will be writing in this Readme file as i progress with my code on the website
so i can keep track of what i have learned during the first HTML course. I am very confident in my ability to create a nice looking website, or as nice you can
get it without the styling of css, just pure pictures, links and text as eye-candy. This will be fun.

I have now done my first commit, i really don't know if i did it right but i assume i didn't. i created the foundation for my website, along with the page where my drink and its recipe will be shown. I then used "git add" for both the index file and the page file. And then i committed them both with a little message.

i have now added a image to the website and i am now going to add links to the recipe pages and add all the information for the recipes. I will use unordered lists for the ingredients and the i will use a ordered lists for the the step by step guide on how to make it.

I have now created the main page with header text and a picture eof a aline bar. i have also created an unordered list where i put the links to the recipes.
The recipes page has header text, picture, some text under describing what the recipe is and some info. Under that i have an unordered list where i put all the ingredients and under that i have an ordered list where i go through a step by step guide on how to make the recipe. 

right now i am on my second recipe and i have committed a couple of time where is state my changes and what i have added. Even though this is only the start i feeling like im getting the grasp of things.
