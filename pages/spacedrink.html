        <img src="../img/gargle-blaster.jpg">
        <h3>This drink is considered the best drink in existence, from "The hitchhikers's guide to the galaxy"</h3>
        <p>This drink is an alcoholic beverage invented by the ex-president of the galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox</p>
        <p>It's effects are similar to "having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick"</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Old Janx Spirit (1 bottle)</li>
            <li>Sea water from Santraginus V (1 measure)</li>
            <li>Acturan Mega-gin cubes (3 cubes)</li>
            <li>Fallian marsh gas (4 liters)</li>
            <li>Qualactin Hypermint extract (1 teaspoon)</li>
            <li>Angolian Suntiger tooth</li>
            <li>Zamphuor</li>
            <li>Olive (1 oliv)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Mixing Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V â€” Oh, that Santraginean seawater! Oh, those
                Santraginean fish!</li>
                <li>Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost).</li>
                <li>Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy hikers who have died of
                pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.</li>
                <li>Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the
                dark Qualactin Zones, subtle, sweet and mystic.</li>
                <li>Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the
                heart of the drink.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle Zamphuor.</li>
                <li>Add an olive.</li>
                <li>Drink... but... very carefully...</li>
        </ol>
